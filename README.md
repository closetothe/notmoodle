# NOT Moodle

www.notmoodle.com is a simple forum for the students of MECH 215 (C++ for Mechanical Engineers). The backend runs on an Ubuntu virtual machine with NodeJS, Express MongoDB.

I created it for two reasons:

1. To communicate with the students. As a TA, I don't have access to the course website (usually Moodle).
2. When I took IFT 2035 at L'Université de Montréal, I noticed that the students (including myself) found great use in an active discussion forum, especially for a programming course. At Concordia, no such forum exists, or at least none that is voluntarily used by anybody.

It seems to be doing its job.
